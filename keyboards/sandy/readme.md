Sandy is a Keyboard with key height optimization

Layered PCB will make height differences for each key. This covers the lack of optimization to physical key layout that only adjust vertical and horizontal in a plane.

For comfortable typing. Easy to type keys far from home position.

Ex.

- "T" and "Y"
- R1 row, Numerics and Symbols
- R2 Mod keys
