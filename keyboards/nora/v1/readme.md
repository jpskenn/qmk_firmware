Nora is a narrow pitch keyboard with Choc v1 low profile switches, designed for MBK or smaller keycaps.  
It can be used with GH60 and Poker compatible low profile cases or original bottom plate.

Nora has 3 layouts.

- Full: Full key. 65% style.
- FW: Separated style.
- RE: FW + Rotary Encoder

Narrow pitch makes fingers easy to reach keys far from home position, "T" and "Y", R1 numerics and symbols.  
It also reduces stretching fingers and reduces changing the position of wrist.  
You can continue tying without breaking the position of finger, wrist and elbow.
