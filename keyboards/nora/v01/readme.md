# Nora

![Nora](TODO:link)

Nora is a narrow pitch 65% keyboard with Choc(v1) low profile switches.  
5 * 16 keys, plus one column to normal 60% keyboards, in 60% case.

It has symmetrical gapless R1-R2 rows like [Jones](https://github.com/jpskenn/Jones), with Cherry's 1800 stile arrow keys and numeric pad.

Narrow pitch makes fingers easy to reach keys far from home position, "T" and "Y", R1 numerics and symbols.  
It also reduces stretching fingers and reduces changing the position of wrist.  
You can continue tying without breaking the position of finger, wrist and elbow.

It can be used with GH60 and Poker compatible low profile cases or original bottom plate.
